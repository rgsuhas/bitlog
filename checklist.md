checklist for ==>[[blog-site]] 


- [ ] Below is a clear, fool-proof checklist for each phase, structured to help you deliver a demo-ready product and iteratively showcase progress on your resume or portfolio.
	
	- [ ] ## **Phase 1: Basic Blog MVP**
	
	- [ ] **Functionality:**
	
	- [ ] Upload Markdown files or connect a local folder
	    
	- [ ] Parse and render markdown blog posts with clean UI
    

- [ ] **Checklist:**

- [ ]  Project repo initialized with Next.js using recommended folder structure
    
- [ ]  Landing page (`/pages/index.tsx`) showing list of blog posts
    
- [ ]  Markdown uploader: drag-and-drop or file input for `.md` files
    
- [ ]  Parse Markdown using a library (`remark`, `markdown-it`, etc.)
    
- [ ]  Render parsed blog post at clean route (`/blog/[slug].tsx`)
    
- [ ]  Minimal responsive UI: basic header, readable typography, list of posts
    
- [ ]  Error boundary and 404-pages—graceful handling of missing/corrupt markdown
    
- [ ]  Deploy on Vercel and confirm live URL works
    

- [ ] ## **Phase 2: In-Browser Editing & Live Preview**

- [ ] **Functionality:**

- [ ] Edit posts in-browser
    
- [ ] Live Markdown rendering/preview
    

- [ ] **Checklist:**

- [ ]  Integrate Markdown editor library (SimpleMDE, Monaco, CodeMirror, etc.)
    
- [ ]  Live-preview pane alongside editor (update as user types)
    
- [ ]  Edit/save support: update file content and show change immediately
    
- [ ]  Protect editing routes for logged-in users (basic auth with NextAuth.js/Clerk)
    
- [ ]  Toasts/snackbars for edit/save actions
    
- [ ]  Mobile-friendly editing experience
    
- [ ]  Update routing: “Edit this post” button on post page
    
- [ ]  Deployment and sanity testing on Vercel
    

- [ ] ## **Phase 3: One-Click Publish & Blog Deployment**

- [ ] **Functionality:**

- [ ] Instantly publish blog to custom subdomain
    
- [ ] HTTPS and CDN integrated
    

- [ ] **Checklist:**

- [ ]  User triggers “publish” from editor or dashboard
    
- [ ]  Generate subdomain or unique share link for the blog
    
- [ ]  All blog pages accessible under subdomain
    
- [ ]  Automatically enable HTTPS (Vercel SSL by default)
    
- [ ]  CDN delivery confirmed (use Vercel’s built-in CDN)
    
- [ ]  Show “live” toast or snackbar with shareable URL
    
- [ ]  Add robots.txt and sitemap.xml for SEO basics
    
- [ ]  All links (home, posts, editor) function on deployed version
    
- [ ]  Perform end-to-end smoke test: upload, edit, publish, view live
    

- [ ] ## **Phase 4: Embeddables, Smart Linking, and Integrations**

- [ ] **Functionality:**

- [ ] Generate embeddable widgets for code or diagrams
    
- [ ] Auto-linking and smart references between posts
    
- [ ] Scaffold integration hooks (e.g., GitHub)
    

- [ ] **Checklist:**

- [ ]  Detect code blocks and diagrams (e.g., Mermaid, math) in Markdown
    
- [ ]  Generate unique, shareable embed code (iframe or JS script) per code block/diagram
    
- [ ]  Smart linking: auto-update/correct links between posts if slugs change
    
- [ ]  Auto-generate Table of Contents (TOC) on each blog post
    
- [ ]  Markdown parser auto-fixes invalid/missing internal links
    
- [ ]  Scaffold endpoints to connect to GitHub: (sync repo or webhook ready, even as a placeholder)
    
- [ ]  Integration-ready API/webhook endpoints for future (e.g., Zapier)
    
- [ ]  Show embeddable widget on post page with copy-to-clipboard feature
    
- [ ]  Final production deployment review & update your portfolio/demo README
    

- [ ] ## **Tips for Each Phase**

- [ ] Test each feature locally and on production Vercel URL.
    
- [ ] Keep code modular (components, hooks, API functions).
    
- [ ] Leave TODO comments for any future/completed enhancements.
    
- [ ] Commit each checklist item as a separate, descriptive commit for easy project tracking.
